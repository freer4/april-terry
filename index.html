    <h2>Doesn't this make you look bad?</h2>
    <p>
        I've been hearing about my children being abused for over six years, and told repeatedly to just keep my head down and let the system handle it. 
        If someone cares more about my airing of April's behavior than her actual behavior, I simply do not care about their opinion.

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p class="narrative">
        April Terry and I were together for nearly five years. We had one child in that time, who will be referred to as Child A, who was born in 2011. When I left her, 
        she was pregnant with our second child, who will be referred to as Child B, who was born in 2014. 
    </p>
    <p class="narrative">April Terry was physically and emotionally abusive towards me during our time together. I did no know how to recognize this at the time, 
        and have been in therapy the last several years regarding this and other April-related scenarios. All I knew at the time is that our relationship had become
        extremely toxic, and somehow I had to get out.</p>
    <p class="narrative">Initially, we were to be civil about child arrangements. I also provided her with financial support. There was no legal agreement in place. Shame on me.</p>
    <p class="narrative">Late in 2014 she began placing extreme restrictions on my ability to see my own children. I finally filed pro-se (that is, without an attorney) for a simple
        shared-parenting arrangement so I could be with my girls regularly.
    </p>
    <p class="narrative">At that time, I had taken a contract with a law firm. She showed up to the first hearing with an attorney and attempted to get me to agree to extremely unfavorable terms.</p>
    <p>[insert court records here]</p>
    <p class="narrative">The law firm I was working for agreed to represent me pro-bono (meaning I had, at this point, "free lawyers"). April's attorney disappeared from the case. 
        This is important: if I had wanted to bully her or be unfair, I could have at this time. Instead, we filed a shared parenting agreement and skipped out on all 
        the nasty courtroom stuff.</p>
    <p class="narrative">April was then evicted and her car repossesed. Instead of flexing some of that legal muscle, I half-bought her a car and made major personal 
        concessions to support her.</p>
