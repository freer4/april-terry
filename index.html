        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>Freer Hall, April's former boyfriend and father to two of April Terry's four children.</p>
        <p>In defense of myself, I have been going to therapy for years now. I've had two psycological evaluations. I have been diagnosed with situation depression and anxiety regarding 
            April torturing my children, and ADHD but that's no surprise. I am currently being treated for Complex PTSD. I have followed every recommendation for treatment set forth 
            by the mental health professionals who have been helping me.</p>
        <p>I would rather be crazy than my children be in harm's way. Alas, it is not so. Both evaluations have come back essentially the same - I'm traumatized over the 
            events that have transpired with my children, and I am not in any way paranoid or delusional.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Doesn't this make you look bad?</h2>
        <p>
            I've been hearing about my children being abused for over six years, and told repeatedly to just keep my head down and let the system handle it. 
            If someone cares more about my airing of April's behavior than her actual behavior, at this point I simply do not care about their opinion. 
        </p>

        <h2>So what does this accomplish?</h2>
        <p>Given the looks we get from some other parents around here we know April has interacted with, and stories we've been told by a few of them, 
            my wife and I are aware April bad-mouths us to others constantly. This should clear some of that up. 
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully, this will turn April into a pariah. This should hurt her chances of obtaining and maintaining employment, housing, or literally any sort of help from anyone. 
            That sounds harsh and heartless... but she preys on goodwill of others, manipulates situations and people for her own benefit, tortures children for fun, 
            and is generally a psycopath. Keep this woman well away from you, your kids, and anyone or anything you care about.</p>
        <p>I'm not being coy about this. There is no hidden agenda. The goal here is to expose April Terry, 
            hopefully encourage others to come forward, and ensure her reign of terror comes to an end.</p>

        <h1>Context (roughly chronological order)</h1>
        <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
        <p class="narrative">April Terry is an absusive, amoral criminal who will hurt anyone for fun or profit and then cry and play the victim. To the best of my knowledge, she's a 6' tall, 
            300-400 pound sadist who has asaulted five children and two adults just that I've been made aware of. Both the Marion Police Department and Marion County Children Services 
            have investigated and found evidence of her abusing children. Why isn't she in prison? Read the long form.</p>
        <H2>The long story</h2>
        <p class="narrative">
            April Terry and I were together for nearly five years. We had one child in that time, who will be referred to as Child A, who was born in 2011. When I left her, 
            she was pregnant with our second child, who will be referred to as Child B, who was born in 2014. 
        </p>
        <p class="narrative">April Terry was physically and emotionally abusive towards me during our time together, increasingly so as our relationship progressed. I did no know how to recognize 
            this at the time, and have been in therapy the last several years regarding this and other April-related scenarios. All I knew at the time is that our relationship had become
            extremely toxic, and somehow I had to get out. She would do things like punch me, slap me upside the head, or disparage me, then say things to the affect of "if you didn't
            make me angry I wouldn't have to hurt you." She would also ensure I was isolated, "punishing" me for speaking with friends or family behind her back if she found out about it.</p>
        <p class="narrative">Initially, we were simply to be civil about child arrangements. I also provided her with financial support. There was no legal agreement in place. Shame on me.</p>
        <p class="narrative">As a note: I've been told outright by April's mother, Judy Terry, that "I never gave her a dime" - during the proceedings of our initial custody case, I was able
            to provide documentation to the many thousands of dollars of direct support I was providing. Her apartment was in my name and being paid by me. Her utilities, the same. Her car and insurance, the same. 
            I even had receipts from her bank with her personal checking account number where I was making additional cash deposits on top of all these bills to provide for her for several months post-breakup. 
            So, Judy: you're wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="speculative">From some of what I've been able to gleam, this narrative was pushed by April on Judy and others, and Judy may have also been providing April with money during 
            this time. April did not work for more than six months prior to us splitting up. If Judy wasn't providing her with support, where then did she think April was coming up with the funds? 
            There are many times I want to see Judy as a victim here, but given what I know about her covering up her husband's abusive behavior and then later her willfully lying in court for April, 
            it's hard to feel bad.
        </p>

            Never assume that a violent partner is only violent because of you. You are not responsible for the actions of anyone else. I cannot stress enough that 
            you need to reach out to people who can help you if you are in such a situation.
        </strong></p>
        <p class="narrative">Late in 2014 she began placing extreme restrictions on my ability to see my own children. I finally filed pro-se (that is, without an attorney) for a simple
            shared-parenting arrangement so I could be with my girls regularly.</p>
        <p class="narrative">At that time, I had taken a contract with a law firm. She showed up to the first hearing with an attorney and attempted to get me to agree to extremely unfavorable terms.</p>
        <p class="narrative">The law firm I was working for agreed to represent me pro-bono (meaning I had, at this point, "free lawyers"). April's attorney disappeared from the case. 
            This is important: if I had wanted to bully her or be unfair, I could have at this time. Instead, we filed a shared parenting agreement and skipped out on all 
            the nasty courtroom stuff.</p>
            <p>[insert court records here]</p>
        <p class="narrative">April was then evicted and her car repossesed. Instead of flexing some of that legal muscle, I half-gave her a car (I made half the payments) and made major personal 
            concessions to support her completing school - as part of our agreement, she was to obtain her Medical Billing and Coding Certification, which she did. If anyone knows and can 
            provide evidence or testimony as to why she does not or perhaps cannot work in that field, 
            please contact <a href="mailto:aprilterryinformation@gmail.com">aprilterryinformation@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>The "School Placement" plot</h2>
            <p class="narrative">This is going to sound absolutely paranoid, and on its own wouldn't hold any water. But it's a thing.</p>
            <p class="narrative">In my ignorance I let April have school placement. It seemed like a small issue as neither child had started school yet, I lived in inner city Columbus area and she 
                in Delaware area at the time. Perfectly reasonalbe setup. 
            </p>
            <p class="narrative">Then she moved to Utica. Then said I could have school placement if I got into a decent district, which caused me to move very unfavorably. She then backed out.</p>
    
        <h2>The "Toenail" incident</h2>
            <p class="narrative">Fast forward to May 18th, 2017. I received a call from the preschool our children attended. Child A had a mild injury and they were unable to contact April.
                I immediately proceed to the facility. Child A had half of her big toenail flipped over backwards inside her shoe and sock. Cringy, but not the worst injury. However, the 
                statements made by Child A, at the facility, in front of facility staff, after having just spent a solid week with April, and with zero prompting from me, indicated that 
                this may have been an abusive situation. Essentially, April had opened the door to the facility 
                in a hurry and hit the top of Child A's foot. That in and of itself, still not a serious concern. However, she then stated 
                "mommy said it was my fault she hurt me". </p>
            [voicemail transcript]
            [incident report]
            <p class="narrative">Queue my PTSD response, though I wouldn't know what that was for some years yet.</p>
            <p class="narrative">I immediately proceeded to speak with an attorney. They advised I attempt to negotiate directly with her before we blow it up into a big expensive legal mess. 
                There were several other small things, things that I know now were big red flags, leading up to this point, but that incident was the eye-opener that I had to protect my children
                from their own mother. </p>
            <p class="narrative">As this was my day to start my parenting time, I picked both children up from preschool later that day. Child A was still distraught from the morning's events, 
                saying repeatedly "it's my fault mommy hurt me".</p>
            [I actually have a recording of part of this but not so sure I want to publish it and I honestly can't watch it without breaking down.]
            <p class="narrative">April was getting married 2 days later. Once calmed, I decided to be passive for the time and confront her about it after her honeymoon, which I did. She agreed 
                to meet in public and we discussed the issue. I asked that she remand her half of the custody to her mother in the short term, take a parenting class, get a 
                psycological evaluation and seek counselling.</p>
            <p class="narrative">She said, paraphrasing here, "no". I filed for a change in custody, she lawyered up. When we later offered to drop any questions of custody if she 
                did the above, she instead spent more than an year and likely many thousands of dollars fighting in court to avoid getting a psycological evaluation. 
            </p>

        <h2>The "Bruised Face" incident</h2>
            <p class="evidence">Child A was then taken to her pediatrician by April with bruising to the face, where April claimed that she believed I had attacked my daughter. 
                At this time, we were essentially week/week split parenting time, meaning I wouldn't see them for 7 days in a row, then see them for 7 days straight.</p>            
            [child A medical record for facial bruising]
            <p class="speculative hearsay">This is partially speculative, and partially based on what I've heard from her now ex-husband and his family: April beat Child A for 
                causing her mother this problem, then tried to blame it on me to throw off any case brought against her. I was not aware of this doctor visit for several months after the fact, 
                and I do not recall any such injury to Child A when she did return to me.
            </p>


        <h2>The "Daycare Conspiracy" issue</h2>
            <p class="narrative">
                Daycare/preschool would start seeing problems, reporting issues, or confronting April. April would start hurling accusations from conspiracy to 
                sexual misconduct at them and then switch daycares. Which leads into:
            </p>

        <h3>The Therapy issue</h3>
            <p class="narrative"></p>

        <h2>The "Curtain Rod" incident</h2>
            <p class="narrative">
                In June 2019 Child B provided a story to myself and others that she had been picked up by the throat, pinned to the wall, and smacked twice with a 
                curtain rod, then grabbed by the shoulder and squeezed by April Terry following an incident where her and Child C were playing and accidentally pulled down the curtains in 
                their bedroom. Child A was not witness to this event. April did confirm the curtain being pulled down, but denied any wrongdoing or abuse on her part. 
            </p>
            <p class="narrative">I did get a protection order for a few weeks over this incident, but ultimately the lack of evidence caused it to be dropped. Children Services "screened out" this 
                report and did not investigate.

        <h2>The "Salt Gun" incident</h2>
            <p class="hearsay">Shot her kids with an air-powered salt gun designed to kill bugs. The story I was told was of her attack Child A, B, and C with it, 
                and specifically of having Child C face down, on the floor, shirtless and weeping while April took great joy and laughed about shooting her in the back with it.
                This story was told to me by both Child A and Child B, together and unprompted, circa 2020.
            </p>
            <p class="evidence">April later claimed in court to have no knowledge of any such weapon ever being in her home.</p>
            <p class="hearsay">Steven (then-husband) has told me she asked him to hide the weapon in the garage one day, and then it later disappeared. He was able to provide the 
                Amazon receipt for the weapon, but of course that's not beyond-a-reasonable-doubt evidence against April.

        <h2>The "Sheriff Deputy" confrontation</h2>
        <p>Not putting up any names, or identifiers, or what agency, etc. I think they were just a young, naive deputy who was lead to believe they were being the "white knight" 
            in this situation. It was handled to my satisfaction, assuming nothing further comes of this.</p>
        <p>I had kept Child A and B out of school a few days while trying to figure out how to file the emergency custody thing without bungling it up. The reason for keeping them out
            was that if they went, April would get her hands on them. This was the advice I was given by people from certain free consultation services. 
        <p>I then received a call from a Sheriff deputy the very first day - within hours of them missing school, really - who told me outright they were going to have me brought up
            on charges of truancy if I didn't bring them in to the school. That was definitely unprofessional and probably illegal - I hadn't actually broken any laws at that point. Truancy 
            is a far more rigorous standard than "your kids were late for school". I just did a "well that was weird" and chocked it up to some johnny-law badass being overzealous.
        </p>
        <p>Fast forward a couple days, I have the emergency custody order in hand granting me full, sole custody rights to Child A and Child B effective immediately. I bring them into school.</p>
        <p>April shows up. She immediately has the school summon <i>this particular Sheriff's deputy by name</i>. This deputy, now with the ECO in their hands, repeatedly tells me 
        that April can take the children home with her, and starts lawyering reasons why this ECO doesn't prevent it. Queue fifteen of the absolute most harrowing minutes of my life as 
        I am full-out panicking that this deputy is going to let the woman who broke my daughter's arm walk out of this building with them.</p>
        <p>Finally, after several back-and-forths, the school principal has this deputy replaced with another, let's call it a more "seasonsed" deputy. This deputy takes all of about sixty seconds
            to read the ECO, concludes what it says it what it says, and then escorts April out of the building, not to return for a very long time. 
        </p>
        <p class="speculative">I later got the feeling that the first deputy got a "stern talking to" about the incident and I've not had any further incidents regarding that individual.</p>
        <p>When I say April is manipulative, I mean it.</p>

        <h2>The "Amber Hickman" problem</h2>
        <p class="narrative">While I had issues with some of April's family, Amber Hickman initially was not one of them. Even when I had protection orders or 
            emergency custody, she was allowed to continue interacting with our daughters. It went so far as to having several of April's family members attend a 
            birthday party while our girls were under a protection order against April.
        </p>
        <p class="narrative">So then comes out, from the court, that Amber tried to get my children to lie to the magistrate. Turn out she'd also falsified a report to MCCS 
            to <span class="speculative">likely trying to poison them against me while they were supposedly investigating April.</span> This will become very relevant.</p>
        <p class="evidence">Amber Hickman is an owner, along with her husband, of <a href="https://www.onlinemastermind.com/" target="_blank">MasterMind LLC</a>, which to my knowledge does mostly 
            government contracts. It is based out of 
            Delaware County, Ohio.
        </p>
        [court findings]
        <p class="speculative">This is purely speculation, but for anyone who's ever worked with government agencies, having connections can get you lots of "special treatment". 
            I don't have any direct evidence that anything like that is what happened here, but I also don't have any reasonable examplaination for what you're about to read, so 
            what conclusion would you draw?

        <p>Suffice to say, despite being a liscensed nurse and mandated reporter caught manipulating children to cover for child abuse, Amber Hickman hasn't lost her liscense or faced 
            any repercussions whatsoever so far as I'm aware.</p>

        <h2>The "Judy Terry" problem</h2>
        <p class="narrative">Works for Delaware County JFS. Nasty piece of work. Has lied under oath for April. Honestly it was so pathetic what April did to her
            in that court room that I actually felt bad for her... but she's helped April cover for beating my kids, so she can go to hell.
        </p>
        <p>So yes, one family member works for the county government, the other owns a local company that does government contracts, and there's been a bunch of really 
            shady stuff going on while these two people have perjured themselves to cover for a child abuser. 
        </p>

        <h2>The "Strangling" issue</h2>
        <p class="narrative">Possibly the only real documented case of physical abuse against him, though he claims many more, April attacked and 
            strangled her then-husband Steven Marshall nearly unconcious. Text messages are notoriously difficult to use in court cases because it's hard to prove someone 
            else didn't just happen to send incriminating texts from your phone. However, in this case, all of these texts where confirmed, by April, under oath, 
            to have been sent from her to her husband.

        <h2>Playing soldier</h2>
        <p class="hearsay">
            Mason Lawson told my children that he'd protect them from me. He also likes to make them do "army drills" as punishment.
        </p>
        <p class="speculative"> 
            That's right, this "man", <span class="evidence">living rent-free in the house of the man he cucked</span>, reportedly likes to play "real soldier" after 
            playing Call-of-Duty-Soldier all day by 
            making little girls crawl through the brush in their back yard. They come home with minor scrapes and such - certainly nothing that's going 
            to get him investigated, if a broken arm and an eye witness couldn't get any traction. But let's all boo this "man".
        </p>
        <p class="speculative">He was apparently in the Marines, which is to say he qualified as a tan-belt warrior then immediately medicalled out.
            I don't actually know and haven't been able to get any solid data here, just a few third-hand stories about his "time". If anyone knows more about this 
            absolute walking trash bag who drives a sports car with a marine plate while drill-seargenting little girls, please send us an email:

        {YOU'LL LOSE YOUR KID IF YOU REPORT HER ABUSE}
        <h2>Basketball extortion</h2>
        <p class="narrative">
            April has told me that Child B "gives each of us different stories" or has told April that Child B doesn't want to play basketball but that I am
            forcing her to play sports. To be absolutely clear here in case you do not know me, I would never force one of my kids to play a sport they didn't want to,
            or unduly pressure them to in any way. We have a strict "once you start a season you finish it" policy, but neither I nor the wife have been pressuring any of our kids
            to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="speculative">I think April sees another opportunity to cause pain and distress to a child in a way that she can't be prosecuted for.</p>
        <p class="evidence">But what isn't speculation is that April tried to use the situation to extort (is this extortion? lawyers, chime in!) me at her own child's expense.</p>

        <h1>Other issues</h1>

        <h2>She's very intelligent</h2>
        <p class="narrative">April likes to "play stupid", but if you've been around her long enough you'll know she is extremely intelligent. I would wager, 
            if she is ever properly evaluated, she's probably a genius. There are several examples of her cunning in the exploits here. 
        </p>
        <p class="narrative">Do not fall for it. Everything she does is likely carefully calculated. See the school placement issue, the free housing issue, the 
            witness tampering, or the bizare police reports for just a few examples.</p> 

        <h2>Theft</h2>
        <p class="narrative">Early in dating, April told me a sob story about how a manager at her first gas station job as a teen had falsely accused her of stealing some pop. I'm not 
            entirely certain why that story stuck with me.</p>
        <p class="narrative">Towards the end of our relationship, she told me the story again... with a hell of a twist. "Of course I took it, but she couldn't prove anything". This I 
            recall because the way she said it scared the shit out of me, and was a significant factor for that voice in my head screaming "get out".</p>
        <p class="narrative">I caught Child A attempting to shoplift by placing a stuffed animal under her shirt. When confronted about what she was doing, she stated
        "Mom says if I want something I just put it under my shirt and walk out with it." I wouldn't find out until sometime later, but April had recently gained a criminal record.</p>

        Text to my wife when I caught ChildA shoplifting, which incidentally happens to be the day we first found our cat. 
        <p class="narrative"></p>

        <h2>Prenteding to be other people</h2>
        <p>Pretending to be her husband to his friend</p>
        [texts]
        <p>Probably violating a protection order pretending to be her husband</p>
        [texts]

        <h2>Isolation</h2>
        <p>Taking keys/phone</p>

        <h2>Driving</h2>
        <p class="evidence">She has a <strong>lot</strong> of moving violations.</p>
        [all the tickets and stuff she's had]

        <h2>Witness tampering, falsifying charges, lying to the police</h2>
        <p class="evidence">This is a doozy. When her then-mother-in-law reached out to me regarding things she had witnessed, April falsified charges against her. </p>
        <p class="narrative">The wrong address for her was provided, <span class="speculative">which I would speculate was so this entire situation would play out.</span></p>
        <p class="hearsay">MIL was military and involved in a car accident in another state while on duty. They informed her she had a bench warrant out for her arrest in Ohio. 
            This is reportedly the first she'd heard of it. 
        </p>
        provided counter-evidence.
        ... everything dropped, but nothing ever done about it.
            
        <h2>Cheating</h2>
        <p>Cheating on her husband for years. Which is a her problem, but the fascinating thing here was how she was bragging about it like she didn't understand 
            this was not a socially acceptable behavior. For at least two years she was maintaining a relationship with another man, and then it lead this doozy:
        </p>

        <h2>Free housing</h2>
        <p>April has, without legal representation, been running the courts in circles. This house she's living in has gone to auction several times, each time 
            the auction has been cancelled last minute due to some legal maneuver by April. Once, the house <i>actually sold</i> at auction, and she got the sale
            cancelled.  
        </p>

        <h2>Threats</h2>
        <p>When she found out that I was dating my now-wife, April sent her messages via Facebook. (Some people know me as Randy...) "I will take this legally" absolutely 
            sounds like a threat to me, and my wife is an LSW who was working in foster placement at the time. So this was a crime. I convinced her to be cool, that April was 
            just chest-thumping and wouldn't actually do anything - not that she could, nothing had happened. 
            I should have let my now-wife wipe the floor with her. Damn me being passive. 
        </p>
        <img src="Screenshot952018-03-28-12-04-50001.png" />
        <p>This ties back into the therapy stuff - April here claims sexual impropriety. When Child A started therapy shortly after this, when asked about concerns of 
            sexual abuse, I brought up this and other concerns April had leveraged against me with the therapist. When therapy came up in court, April claimed that I had
            been mentioned sexual abuse to make her look bad and that's why the therapist has mentioned it - completely forgetting that it was her making the allegations in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>In all the years of therapy for Child A and/or Child B, to this day no therapist has mentioned one word of concern to me that either of them has been sexually abused.</p>

        <h2>Fired</h2>
        <p class="hearsay">Supposedly fired from Kroger for "calling a coworker with down syndrome a 'retard'". This is second hand from her ex husband, so 
            do with that what you will.
        </p>

        <h2>"Trap babies"</h2>
        <p>At least two of her children have pretty suspicious timings. Child C and Child D.</p>

        <h2>School issues</h2>
        <p>Child A, B, and C issues at school.</p>

        <h2>Taking "what she wants"</h2>
        <p>Imma just leave this here.</p>
