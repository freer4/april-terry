    <h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>
    <p>To provide information about April Terry.</p>

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>Freer Hall, former boyfriend and father to two of April Terry's four children.</p>
    
    <h2>Doesn't this make you look bad?</h2>
    <p>
        I've been hearing about my children being abused for over six years, and told repeatedly to just keep my head down and let the system handle it. 
        If someone cares more about my airing of April's behavior than her actual behavior at this point, I simply do not care about their opinion. 
    </p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <div class="narrative">
        <p>TL;DR: April Terry is an absusive, amoral criminal who will hurt anyone for fun or profit and then cry and play the victim. To the best of my knowledge, she's a 6' tall, 300-400 
            pound pile of sadistic who has asaulted five children and two adults just that I've been made aware of. Both the Marion Police Department and Marion County Children Services 
            have investigated and found evidence of her abusing children. Why isn't she in prison? Read the long form.</p>
        <p>The long form:</p>
        <p>
            April Terry and I were together for nearly five years. We had one child in that time, who will be referred to as Child A, who was born in 2011. When I left her, 
            she was pregnant with our second child, who will be referred to as Child B, who was born in 2014. 
        </p>
        <p>April Terry was physically and emotionally abusive towards me during our time together, increasingly so as our relationship progressed. I did no know how to recognize 
            this at the time, and have been in therapy the last several years regarding this and other April-related scenarios. All I knew at the time is that our relationship had become
            extremely toxic, and somehow I had to get out. She would do things like punch me, slap me upside the head, or disparage me, then say things to the affect of "if you didn't
            make me angry I wouldn't have to hurt you."</p>
        <p>Initially, we were simply to be civil about child arrangements. I also provided her with financial support. There was no legal agreement in place. Shame on me.</p>
        <p>Late in 2014 she began placing extreme restrictions on my ability to see my own children. I finally filed pro-se (that is, without an attorney) for a simple
            shared-parenting arrangement so I could be with my girls regularly.</p>
        <p>At that time, I had taken a contract with a law firm. She showed up to the first hearing with an attorney and attempted to get me to agree to extremely unfavorable terms.</p>
        <p>[insert court records here]</p>
        <p>The law firm I was working for agreed to represent me pro-bono (meaning I had, at this point, "free lawyers"). April's attorney disappeared from the case. 
            This is important: if I had wanted to bully her or be unfair, I could have at this time. Instead, we filed a shared parenting agreement and skipped out on all 
            the nasty courtroom stuff.</p>
        <p>April was then evicted and her car repossesed. Instead of flexing some of that legal muscle, I half-bought her a car and made major personal 
            concessions to support her completing school - as part of our agreement, she was to obtain her Medical Billing and Coding Certification, which she did. If anyone knows and can 
            provide evidence or testimony as to why she does not or perhaps cannot work in that field, please <a href="">let me know</a>.</p>
            <p>[insert court records here]</p>

        <p>Fast forward to May 18th, 2017. I received a call from the preschool our children attended. Child A had a mild injury and they were unable to contact April (her day)
            I immediately proceed to the facility. Child A has half a toenail flipped over backwards. Cringy, but not the worst injury. However, the statements made by Child A, on April's day, 
            at the facility, in front of facility staff, with zero prompting from me, indicated that this may have been an abusive situation. Essentially, April had opened the door to the facility 
            in a hurry and hit the top of Child A's foot. That in of itself, still not a serious concern. However, she then stated 
            "mommy said it was my fault she hurt me". </p>
        [voicemail transcript]
        [incident report]
        <p>I immediately proceeded to speak with an attorney. They advised I attempt to negotiate directly with her before we blow it up into a big expensive legal mess.</p>
        <p>As this was my day to start my parenting time, I picked both children up from preschool. Child A was still distraught from the morning's events, 
            saying repeatedly "it's my fault mommy hurt me".</p>
        [I actually have a recording of part of this but not so sure I want to publish it and I honestly can't watch it without breaking down.]
        <p>April was getting married 2 days later. Once calmed, I decided to be passive for the time and confront her about it after her honey moon, which I did. She agreed 
            to meet in public and we discussed the issue. I asked that she remand her half of the custody to her mother in the short term, take a parenting class, get a 
            psycological evaluation and seek counselling.</p>
        <p class="evidence">Child A was then taken to her pediatrician by April with bruising to the face and April claimed that I had attacked my daughter. At this time, we were essentially week/week split parenting time, meaning I 
            wouldn't see them for 7 days in a row, then see them for 7 days straight.</p>            
        [child A medical record for facial bruising]
        <p class="speculative hearsay">This is partially speculative, and partially based on what I've heard from her now ex-husband and his family: April beat Child A for 
            causing her mother this problem, then tried to blame it on me to throw off any case brought against her. I was not aware of this doctor visit for several months after the fact, 
            and I do not recall any such injury to Child A when she did return to me.
